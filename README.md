Description
A data validator is a library that can be used to verify the correctness of any data. There are many similar libraries in every language, since almost all programs work with external data that needs to be checked for correctness. First of all, we are talking about the data of the forms filled out by users.

Utility features:

Validation of string data;
Validation of numerical data;
Validation of Map type objects;
Validation of data inside Map objects.
